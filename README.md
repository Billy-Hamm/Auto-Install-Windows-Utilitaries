# Auto-Install-Windows-Utilitaries
Just a Batch script that checks os architecture and version, then auto installs some basic utilitaries.

I'm using batch instead of another "language" because it comes in ready in windows, no need to install anything unlike Python or Java.

You just need to edit the file path (for example: "%~dp0\vlc-3.0.18-win64.exe) in order for it to work (for example: "%~dp0\vlc-3.0.18-win64.exe)

(the .exe files are not included, no use for that as they are all free software and are often updated)
